# Sample Ruby Platformer - Hastily-coded platformer game in ruby + gosu engine

This is a basic, no-frills platformer game coded in ruby using the gosu
engine. Essentially you are a computer glitch collecting floppy disks / cdroms
while avoiding spikes.

Basically this game demostrates how loading images and handling tile data can
be done in ruby.

Maybe one day it will be completed, but for now it is more of a simple demo.
Feel free to fork it and use it for other projects if you find it useful.
